# js-bsp-funtimes
Inspired, and based upon the the project [CSG.JS on Github](https://github.com/evanw/csg.js)/ [CSG.JS Docs](http://evanw.github.io/csg.js/docs/).

The goal of this project is to re-write the above framework into a library that can be used to demonstrate rendering of moving objects, shadowing, collision detection, and more!
